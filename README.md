## HW1

### hw1-1 Recursion Function

This assignment focuses on RISC-V assembly language and involves the implementation of a recursion function.

### hw1-2 Caesar Cipher Encryption

In this task, students are required to implement Caesar cipher encryption using RISC-V assembly.

## HW2

### ALU Module Implementation with Verilog

Homework 2 involves the implementation of an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using Verilog.

## Final Project

### CPU Implementation with Verilog

The final project is a CPU implementation using Verilog. The CPU supports basic RISC-V instructions and serves as a practical application of the concepts learned throughout the course.

#### Supported Instructions

The CPU is capable of executing a set of basic RISC-V instructions. Students are encouraged to refer to the RISC-V instruction set documentation for details on supported operations.
